After reviewing the following information, if you are interested, send your **resume** and a brief **statement of interest** to Dr. Song at `s.song[at]northeastern.edu` with the subject line "NeuMove Application".

Taking my class, **ME 5374: Neuromechanical simulation of human movement**, in Fall 2025 will be your best opportunity to explore our research area and prepare for potential research involvement.

Undergraduate and master’s students at Northeastern can engage with our lab by volunteering as a **research intern** or pursuing one of our **self-paced study** options. If you have a strong independent idea outside these categories, you are welcome to share it, though we may only accommodate well-developed projects with a solid foundation.

### **Research Internships**
&nbsp;

**Exoskeleton Assistant:** Help conduct ankle exoskeleton experiments
- Commitment:
  - Minimum of 4 hours/week
- Experience you will gain:
  - Conducting human subject experiments
  - Operating ankle exoskeletons
  - Gaining hands-on experience with gait lab systems (motion capture and metabolic measurement systems)

### **NeuMove Study Groups**
&nbsp;

We provide three self-paced study options for students interested in learning more about our research. After reaching out to me, you may explore these materials at your own pace with no obligation to complete them.

- **MyoAssist:** Complete the [MyoAssist online tutorial](https://myoassist.neumove.org)
- **DRL Basics:** Learn the fundamentals of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and its application in MyoSuite. You will practice applying DRL to generate diverse human movements in Python/MyoSuite.
  - [MyoSuite](https://sites.google.com/view/myosuite)
- **Reflex Locomotion Model:** Reimplement our reflex-based neuromechanical simulations in Matlab/Simulink or Python/MyoSuite.
  - [Paper presenting the reflex-based model](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/JP270228)
  - [Video of the reflex-based model](https://youtu.be/ZkOrRcc4dWg?si=zbsGoS9ghmDwdkXB)

&nbsp;

**Process:**
- Contact Dr. Song and indicate which self-paced study track you’re interested in.
- Study the provided material and send weekly progress reports (typically completed within one semester).
- Upon completion, give a presentation to Dr. Song on the studied materials.
- After successfully completing the study phase (including the presentation), if you have more than 6 months before graduation, you will be invited to officially join the lab, where you could collaborate on ongoing projects or pursue your own research ideas under Dr. Song’s supervision.

&nbsp;

**Expected Commitment:**
- Study phase: 5+ hours/week (no obligation on either side to start, complete, or continue)
- Research phase: 10+ hours/week
