Taking my class, **ME 5374: Neuromechanical simulation of human movement**, in Fall 2025 will be your best opportunity to explore our research area and prepare for potential research involvement.

If you are an undergraduate or master's student at Northeastern University, you can engage with our lab in two ways: 1) volunteering as a **research intern** and collaborating with NeuMovers, or 2) participating in self-paced **study groups**.

After reviewing the following information, if you are interested, send your resume and a brief statement of interest to Dr. Song at `s.song[at]northeastern.edu` with the subject line "NeuMove Application".

### **NeuMove Study Groups**
&nbsp;

We are providing two study groups for students interested in learning more about our research:
- **Reflex Group**: Reimplement our reflex-based neuromechanical simulations in Matlab/Simulink or Python/MyoSuite. You will be trained to simulate steady human gait under various conditions (e.g., wearing exoskeletons, musculoskeletal diseases).
  - <a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/JP270228">Paper presenting the reflex-based model</a>
  - <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkOrRcc4dWg?si=zbsGoS9ghmDwdkXB">Video of the reflex-based model</a>
- **DRL Group**: Study the basics of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and its application in MyoSuite. You will be trained to apply DRL to produce diverse human movements in Python/MyoSuite.
  - <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/myosuite">MyoSuite</a>

We provide comprehensive study materials and hold weekly office hours, which you are expected to attend regularly to boost your learning and connect with NeuMovers. These self-paced groups aim for you to master the materials within one semester.

If you have more than one semester remaining until graduation after mastering the materials, you will be invited to become a NeuMover! You will have the opportunity to collaborate on existing projects or develop your own innovative ideas.

Commitment:
- Study phase: 4 hours/week or more
- Research phase: 10 hours/week or more
